Intrinsic
=========
Intrinsic is a set of automated routines to analyze patch clamp recordings. In its present state, the software can automatically analyse *MY protocols* and those currently used in A.Frick's lab. It will SURELY fail with other files, but it should be easy to adapt it to your protocols.
A more flexible version (Intrinsic5) is currently under development.
